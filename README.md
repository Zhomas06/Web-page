# Web-page

The aim of this project is create an initial CV within a webpage.

Additonal notes

    * The main code of this webpage it was developed by hand.
    
        - The only piece of code I have inherited is the Dark mode button (I loved its aesthetics).
    
    * This project was developed in 4 different days. The time distribution was:
        - First day: project selection and broad definition of the project.
        
        - Second and third day were used for the development of the core code of the project.
        
        - Fourth day we implemented CSS improvements and fixed some bugs.
        
    * Self-assessment exercise. Future ideas and improvements:
    
        - Improve the color ratio. (Maybe look for a style that defines me more).
        
        - Customized mouse cursor for when it is positioned over some elements (it would be more vivid).
        
        - Add button to download the CV in the traditional way (in pdf).
        
        - Add Projects section.
        
        - When I finish the PostGrado start from 0 this project to see the progress.
